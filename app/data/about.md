## Why We Built This

Theming Nuxt UI should feel like picking colors, not editing config files. Too often, setting up a design-token system means copy-pasting snippets, toggling dark mode to catch mismatches, and rebuilding just to preview a single shade change.

We wanted a tool where you could see your entire design system render across real components — instantly, in both color modes — and walk away with production-ready code you can paste straight into your project.

## Your Theme, Configured Visually

Nuxt UI Theme Builder is a free, open-source application that lets you visually configure Nuxt UI v4 design tokens — semantic colors, neutral palette, border radius, font family, and per-mode shade overrides — then export the result as `app.config.ts`, CSS variables, or JSON.

Every change is instantly previewed across 125+ real Nuxt UI components, layout blocks, and full-page templates so you can see exactly how your theme looks before shipping it.

## Key Features

- **Live preview** — every component, block, and template re-renders in real time as you adjust tokens.
- **Multiple export formats** — drop the output straight into your project as `app.config.ts`, a CSS snippet, or raw JSON.
- **Built-in presets** — start from curated themes and customize from there.
- **Undo / Redo** — full history support so you can experiment freely.
- **Save & manage themes** — persist multiple themes locally and switch between them.
- **AI theme generation** — describe your design vision in plain language and let AI generate a complete starting point.
- **Dark & light mode** — separate shade overrides for each color mode.
- **No account required** — theme data stays in your browser. The only external calls are AI prompts, which go directly to the provider you choose (bring your own API key).
- **Learn & tooling** — browse [theming guides](/learn) and use built-in [color tools](/tools) to support your design workflow.
