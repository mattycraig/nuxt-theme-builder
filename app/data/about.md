## What Is It?

Nuxt UI Theme Builder is a single-page application that lets you visually configure Nuxt UI v4 design tokens — semantic colors, neutral palette, border radius, font family, and per-mode shade overrides — then export the result as `app.config.ts`, CSS variables, or JSON.

Every change you make is instantly previewed across a library of real Nuxt UI components, layout blocks, and full-page templates so you can see exactly how your theme looks before shipping it.

## Key Features

- **Live preview** — every component, block, and template re-renders in real time as you adjust tokens.
- **Multiple export formats** — drop the output straight into your project as `app.config.ts`, a CSS snippet, or raw JSON.
- **Built-in presets** — start from curated themes and customize from there.
- **Undo / Redo** — full history support so you can experiment freely.
- **Save & manage themes** — persist multiple themes locally and switch between them.
- **AI theme generation** — describe your design vision in plain language and generate a complete theme.
- **Dark & light mode** — separate shade overrides for each color mode.
- **Fully client-side** — no backend, no account required, no data leaves your browser.
